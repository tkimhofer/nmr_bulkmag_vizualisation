# ðŸ§² Interactive 3D Visualization of a Standard 1D NMR Experiment

An interactive JavaScript visualisation of the bulk magnetisation vector and detected signals during a standard 1D NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) experiment. 

ðŸ”— **Live demo:** [tkimhofer.github.io/nmr_visualisation](https://tkimhofer.github.io/nmr_visualisation/)

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This project illustrates the fundamental physical processes in a standard 90Â° NMR experiment â€” from nuclear spin alignment to RF excitation, signal precession, relaxation, and data detection â€” using an animated 3D scene rendered with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

It is meant as an educational tool for students of spectroscopy or physics learning about spin dynamics and NMR signal formation.


## ðŸ§© Implementation

The magnetisation dynamics are computed from the analytical solutions to the Bloch equations  <sup id="bloch">1</sup> for free precession and relaxation after a 90Â° pulse in the laboratory frame.

**Key features**
- Animated bulk magnetization vector with 3D axes.
- Real-time exponential `T1` / `T2` relaxation simulation
- Orthogonal detectors and complex signal traces
- Interactive orbit, zoom, and reset button (see upper left)

## ðŸ§  NMR Spectroscopy in Essence

### 1. Sample placement
- Temperature & field stabilisation
- Locking, shimming, tuning & matching, RF pulse calibration, etc.

### 2. Nuclear spin alignment
 - NMR-sensitive nuclei align parallel or antiparallel to magnetic field `B0` (vertical/blue axis in [visualisation](https://tkimhofer.github.io/nmr_visualisation/))
 - Parallel/antiparallel orientations correspond to low/high energy states, respectively
 - Slight excess population in the low-energy state â†’ net bulk magnetization (`M`)
 - Population difference proportional to magnetic field strength <sup id="boltz">2</sup>
 - (higher magnetic field strength increases chemical shift dispersion, ie., less peak overlap)

### 3. Bulk magnetization in 3D space
- Bulk magnetization vector `M` (white) is the sum of individual nuclear magnetic moments  
- Longitudinal axis: `z` along `B0` (`Mz` component)
- Transverse axes: `x` (red) and `y` (green), forming the `Mxy` plane

### 4. RF excitation
- Exposed to radiofrequency (RF) pulse -> `B1`
- RF pulse calibrated to rotate `M` by 90Â° into xy-plane
- `M` starts precessing around z-axis at the Larmor frequency (`omega0` in code)

### 5. Signal evolution and detection

**A. Relaxation effects**
- Magnitude of `Mxy` decays while `Mz` recovers, due to: 
- **T2**: mutual magnetic interactions between spins â†’ loss of phase coherence (spin-spin relax.)
- **T1**: interactions with lattice/environment â†’ recovery along z-axis (spin-lattice relax.)
- Typically, `T2 â‰¤ T1`.

**B. Signal detection**
- The precessing `Mxy` induces voltage in two orthogonal receiver coils (90Â° phase difference)
- Detectors / recever channels shown as orange and green cones <sup id="quad">3</sup>
- Resulting time-domain signals are drawn as orange and green traces

**C. Complex signal representation**
- Recorded time-domain signals are a complex-valued: `s(t) = s_Re(t) + i* s_Im(t)`
- The real (`s_Re`) and imaginary (`s_Im`) parts correspond to the two receiver channels
- After Fourier transformation:
  - Real â†’ absorptive line shape
  - Imaginary â†’ dispersive component
 
### 6. Recovery
- Longitudinal magnetization `Mz` grows until equilibrium re-established

### 7. Repetition
- Once equilibrium is reached, the acquisition cycle repeats 
- The number of repetitions (Bruker parameter `NS`: *Number of Scans*) determines signal averaging
- Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) increases proportionally to the square root of the number of scans
